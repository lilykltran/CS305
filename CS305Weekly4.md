#### Summarization

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Facebook has started to take action in filtering out fake news. These changes include allowing users to report fake news, and partnerships with outside fact-checking organizations. They are also changing their advertising practices to prevent fake news from profiting. "But as its reach and influence have grown, it has had to confront questions about its moral obligations and ethical standards regarding what appears on the network" (Isaac 1). Facebook acknowledges that everyone has a right to their own voice, but they also have a moral responsibility to make sure what is said doesn't deceive the public and in turn, affect the public negatively. A bigger issue with this problem is people don't know how much of an impact Facebook alone will make because so many false news creators can propagate their work on different websites. Fake news can have a direct relation to quality of life, such as who the next elected president is.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *NY TIMES*'s article "Fakebook Mounts Effort to Limit Tide of Fake News" does mention that while Facebook must make the ethical decision on filtering out fake news, they also have a duty to themselves to continue profiting. "Facebook must take something else into consideration: its profit. Any action taken to reduce popular content, even if it is fake news, could hurt the companyâ€™s priority of keeping its users engaged on the platform. People spend an average of more than 50 minutes a day on Facebook, and the company wants that number to grow" (Isaac 1). What if filtering out fake news will hurt the company's success? Will Facebook take the moral high ground, or will they watch out for themselves?
