#### Critical Review

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The article "Report: Cheating is Becoming a Big Problem in Online Gaming" by Nelson Granados. He reports that cheating is so common (more than 40% of gamers cheat) because they don't feel as if it is ethically wrong, since no one is getting hurt. "Perhaps what drives online gamers to cheat is the fallacy that the digital world is not real, the same one that drives many to consume pirated content, thinking they are just innocently watching content for free, yet they are hurting real people including emerging artists" (Granados 1). He talks about how cheating not only hurts players who are playing fairly, but ultimately negatively impacts the companies that are profiting from the games. "It has the potential to not only impact other gamers around the world, but also poses a big challenge for game publishers. If cheaters are allowed to prosper, the impact on other players can subsequently lead to lower game traffic and shrinking revenues" (Granados 1). He brings up that the solution to preventing cheating is to attack them from the supply side; to make it technically impossible for cheaters to use cheating tools. In other words, improve security. Granados also mentions that a solution to essentially educate consumers about the consequences of piracy. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While I agree that cheating in general is on the unethical side, it is not so black and white. Granados claims that cheating is unethical because it hurts the consumers and producers, since players that are playing farily feel discouraged to continue playing the games. What if cheaters would only play if they had resources to help them win? I know that I have given up on games countless of times because they were too difficult, and if I had an outside source to help me out, I would've used it and therefore, continued to play the game. Granados doesn't mention how cheating tools can in fact improve the gaming companies' revenues. While improving security could prevent some cheaters, these measures would be extremely sophisticated to implement. Cheating in gaming in inevitable, and calling is a "big problem" to me is an exaggeration. The big picture is some companies are corrupt, and some people are corrupt, and that cheating does not hurt humans to where their lives are greatly impacted. Every scenario must be analyzed in order to determine what is ethical and what is not.
