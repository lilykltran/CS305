&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Internet Hacking is About to Get Much Worse" by the *NY Times* iterates over and over again that regulation is inevitable, and that we as people must accept that since hacking is getting out of hand. It talks about how we need "regulatory agencies to penalize companies with bad security (Schneier 1). The article essentially makes a statement about how security should take precedence over anything else. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I understand why enforcing more government software may be the brute force solution to avoiding malicious software, I believe that the more efficient way to promote security is to simply, promote security. The article mentions some reasonable solutions:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"*The Cybersecurity Framework — which contains guidance on how to identify,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prevent, recover, and respond to security risks — is voluntary at this point, which
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;means nobody follows it. Making it mandatory for critical industries would be a
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;great first step. An appropriate next step would be to implement more specific
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;standards for industries like automobiles, medical devices, consumer goods, and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;critical infrastructure" (Schneier 1).*


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the idea of enforcing security education on engineers, and for there to be more strict guidelines when developing systems. This allows the engineers to continue to have freedom with their development and utilize their creativity. In turn, this will more likely prevent systems from being affected by malicious attacks. "...computers are being embedded into physical devices and will affect lives, not just our data. Security is not a problem the market will solve. The government needs to step in and regulate this increasingly dangerous space" (Schneier 1). I believe that this quote is exaggerated. I do not believe the government should regulate actual software. The only exception to this, in my opinion, are systems that can put the public in life threatening danger if these systems are threatened, such as airplanes. Smaller systems such as cameras, vacuum cleaners, and even cars, need not be regulated. Enforcing higher education on security is a reasonable enough solution to try
