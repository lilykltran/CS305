##### Summary

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ethics of Artificial Intelligence" by Nick Bostrom and Eliezer Yedkowsky talks about how the creation of thinking machines can raise questions in regards to ethics. It talks about the issues that may arise, and how we can assess that the AIs have moral status.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bostrom and Yedkowsky talk about how in the future, a bank using a machine learning algorithm to recommend mortgage applicants may seem racially bias if a person of color applicant gets rejected. This person could potentially fial a lawsuit. The bank claims that this is impossible, since the algorithm is deliberately blinded to the
race of the applicants. Indeed, that was part of the bank’s rationale for implementing the system. Even so, statistics show that the bank’s approval rate for black applicants has been steadily dropping. "When AI algorithms take on cognitive work with social dimensions-cognitive tasks previously performed by humans—the AI algorithm inherits the social requirements" (Botrom,Yedkowsky 1). AIs, despite being claimed to be implemented without bias, has the responsibility to please all social and racial groups. The challenge with AIs is that they can inherit all issues regarding politics, and risk being targeted. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most people can agree that machines have no moral status, as we can change the machines as we please. To ensure moral status, the article claims to establish sentience and sapience. "This picture of moral status suggests that an AI system will have some moral status
if it has the capacity for qualia, such as an ability to feel pain. If in addition to sentience, an AI system also has sapience of a kind similar to that of a normal human adult, then it would have full moral status, equivalent to that of human beings" (Bostrom, Yedkowsky 6).
