&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rapid growth of smart technology has instilled a fear of job replacement and displacement. The McKinsey Global Institute projects that by 2030 up to 800 million jobs worldwide will be at risk for automation, and that 60 percent of current jobs involve at least 30 percent of work that is technically automatable (McKinsey & Company, 2018). There is an ethical concern with smart robots. What happens when people's jobs are replaced? Is it ethical to be taking over so many jobs that are currently common today. McKinsey Global says that “One factory in China has replaced 90% of its human workers with robots already , a move which it says has resulted in fewer defects and an increase in production” (McKinsey & Company, 2018). When it comes to the companies' concern, increased production rates and decrease in payment of employees is the best thing that could happen. However, is this negatively affecting the people?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; McKinsey & Company says this: “We have previously estimated that  global consumption could grow by $23 trillion between 2015 and 2030 , and most of this will come from the consuming classes in emerging economies. The effects of these new consumers will be felt not just in the countries where the income is generated but also in economies that export to these countries. Globally, we estimate that 250 million to 280 million new jobs could be created from the impact of rising incomes on consumer goods alone, with up to an additional 50 million to 85 million jobs generated from higher health and education spending (Mckinsey & Company, 2018). The reality is that technology will continue to advance, and that even though jobs that can be easily replaced by robots will be replaced, but something that many people don't understand is that this replacement will happen slowly. For example, all bank telling jobs will not be replaced in a year;  it will take many years for the machines to be on the market, and these easily repalced jobs will slowly become less popular. New jobs will open up. There is already a trend that computer science degrees are becoming more and more common because people understand this.
