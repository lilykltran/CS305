###### Case Study Review

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Waterfront, Toronto is working with Sidewalk Labs, the urban innovation subsidiary of Google's parent company, Alphabet, in order to design a new neighborhood called Quayside. This new neighborhood will feature infrastructure that prevents flooding, heated roadways, personalized side walks, smart buildings, etc. "Some paths for pedestrians and bikers may not be accessible to vehicles, and autonomous vehicles (AVs) would be restricted to bike speeds for deliveries and local access. Some lanes are designed for walking speed, requiring bikes to be walked and AVs to go about 5 mph at most" (Kotecky 1). Quayside also proposed personalized sidewalks, which means if an old person is walking at a slower pace, there are sensors that will measure their pace, and the street lights won't turn green until they are done crossing the street. The big question is how are these features going to be monitored?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The answer to this question is data collection. There are going to be sensors everywhere in the neighborhood, from how much water you're using (e.g; showers, no. of toilet flushes), to how and when you're traveling. The high tech neighborhood is going to be monitored 24/7, which invokes the big question: can you be spied on? The problem with privacy is that Sidewalk labs is proposing a third party for the data collection. Business Insider raises this concern. "The waterfront project has been scrutinized by privacy experts, who have raised concerns about the company's plan to collect data via sensors that monitor energy usage, noise, traffic, and pollution" (Kotecky 2). There has been security issues in the past where malicious software has been able to retrieve personal information from the public. The idea of the neighborhood, while it is idealistic, is not realistic since there is no ethical way to collect so much personal data without interfering with privacy. The article does make note of people who agree with me as well. "A board member of Waterfront Toronto resigned instead of signing the most recent deal, citing "numerous unanswered questions" about digital privacy and governance as part of her decision" (Kotecky 2). 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The idea of an environmentally friendly neighborhood, suitable for all people to live in, is great. However, a third party ownership of the physical data to be collected is concerning. The only people who should have access to this data is the government. In addition, a trend in smart city marketing is private companies starting up in town promising better urban governance, but are really there to sell software and monetize citizen data. Frankly, I do not believe Quayside will be successful; the neighborhood will always run into ethical issues with data and privacy.
